# What works?

**Well basically it's unusable for daily usage. But hey, it** _**Boots**_**!**

So to sum it up, these work:

* Boots!
* Display
* CPU
* Thermals \(Thermals are stable like windows\)
* Keyboard \(I'm typing this on MacOS Catalina\)
* USB Ports
* Bluetooth
* WiFi \(Needs [itlwm ](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/tags)and [Heliport](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/HeliPort/tags)\)

### What doesn't work?

* GPU \(Display is 7mb\)
* Lags \(Due to lack of GPU HW Acceleration\)
* Audio
* Touchpad
* Graphics intensive Apps

**As I said earlier, it's unstable for daily usage. You can browse web and all, but don't expect it to be butter smooth at all**.
