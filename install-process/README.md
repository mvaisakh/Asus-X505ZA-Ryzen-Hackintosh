# Install Process

So, let's begin with install process, eh?

#### Before you begin remember that this process is not easy. And I quote again "This is still ALPHA!!!!"

Installing hackintosh isn't as easy as installing Windows or Linux as they have pretty much straightforward installation documentation and guides. But this isn't the case with MacOS. MacOS is a proprietary Operating System by Apple, for Apple. Developers from around the world, with their epic efforts have managed to boot this OS on "Non-Apple" hardware successfully and can be used as a daily driver \(Not in our case, yet\).

MacOS does not boot on standard device hardware, and bootloader. It has to be configured by a special bootloader with specific hacks \(which is why it's called a hackintosh\). Present Bootloader options that we have are:

* Opencore
* Clover

### Let's get started

You'll need to have a USB stick of 16GB or more \(MacOS is about 8GB to download\), a good internet connection and ofcourse what we all lack, _a brain_!

You should head over to [Dortania Opencore Guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/) for setting up the Bootloader and Downloading MacOS ad writing it to the USB.
