# Asus VivoBook 15 MacOS (Hackintosh)

## WARNING: This is only for Asus VivoBook 15 X505ZA (Ryzen 5 2500u with Radeon Vega 8), do not try this on Intel based VivoBook 15.

### I do not take responsibility if you do anything wrong and your laptop gets damaged in the process. Do it at your own risk!
### This is still in _ALPHA_ stage, use only if you want to flex with friends that you run macOS on your laptop.

## Present Supported OS: MacOS Catalina 10.15.6

## What Works?

Well basically it's unusable for daily usage. But hey, it _Boots_!

So to sum it up, these work:
* Boots!
* Display (Well kinda no)
* CPU
* Thermals (Thermals are stable like windows)
* Keyboard (I'm typing this on MacOS Catalina)
* USB Ports
* Bluetooth
* WiFi (Needs itlwm and Heliport)

## What Doesn't work? Issues?

Welp:
* GPU (Display is 7mb)
* Lags (Due to lack of GPU HW Acceleration)
* Audio
* Touchpad
* Graphics intensive Apps

As I said earlier, it's unstable for daily usage. You can browse web and all, but don't expect it to be butter smooth at all.
